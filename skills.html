    <h1>Skills</h1>
    <h2>Technical and Personal Skills</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Problem Solving:</strong>I am skilled at developing solutions to
      complex problems and building efficient solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Time Management:</strong> One of my strengths in managing my time is my ability to break 
      larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps.<br> This approach makes daunting tasks less overwhelming 
      and allows me to make steady progress. I am also mindful of setting aside time for breaks and self-care,
     <br>  recognizing that rest is essential for maintaining productivity and avoiding burnout.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Collaboration and Communication:</strong> I believe my greatest strength lies in my ability to be an active listener and open-minded team member.
       I genuinely value diverse perspectives and understand that different viewpoints can lead to more innovative and effective solutions.
       I make a conscious effort to contribute meaningfully to group discussions while also ensuring that others feel heard and respected.
        I try to build a positive environment where everyone's input is valued, which, in turn, fosters trust and cooperation among team members.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Adaptability:</strong> I enjoy stepping out of my comfort zone,
      whether it's learning a new skill or tackling unfamiliar tasks, which
      helps me stay versatile in both academic and personal settings.
